        Welcome to Lemo App (“Lemo”, “we”, “our”, or “us”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the Lemo mobile application and related services designed to manage and restrict mobile phone functionality for students in subscribed educational institutions. By downloading, accessing, or using the Lemo App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

1. Eligibility and Authorization

The scope of these restrictions is determined by the subscribing institution.


3. Device Control and Management

Upon installation, the Lemo App may:
